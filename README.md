# Maze-Solving-Robot

**Introduction:**

In the field of robotics, autonomous navigation is a crucial area of research, with applications ranging from self-driving vehicles to industrial automation. 
The "Autonomous Maze-Solving Robot Using Arduino" is designed to demonstrate intelligent pathfinding using sensor-based navigation and optimization techniques. This project focuses on enabling a robot to 
autonomously navigate through a maze while learning and improving its path using an Arduino Uno, IR Road Tracing Sensor, and L293D motor driver.The robot operates in two phases:
1. First Pass (Exploration Phase): It follows the Left-Hand Rule to explore 
   the maze, record intersections, and identify dead ends.
2. Second Pass (Optimization Phase): The recorded path is analyzed to 
  determine the shortest route, allowing the robot to navigate the maze efficiently in subsequent runs.

This project not only showcases the principles of robotics and automation but 
also introduces basic AI-based path optimization techniques. It is an excellent 
platform for understanding sensor integration, decision-making algorithms, and 
real-time control systems.
Through this project, we aim to explore the potential of autonomous robotic 
navigation and provide insights into optimizing movement in complex 
environments. Future improvements could include machine learning-based path 
prediction, advanced sensor fusion, and real-time adaptive decision-making for 
enhanced efficiency.

**Purpose:**

The "Autonomous Maze-Solving Robot Using Arduino" is designed to demonstrate intelligent pathfinding using sensor-based navigation and optimization techniques. 
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robot capable of autonomously navigating through a maze using an Arduino Uno, IRsensors, and an L293D motor driver. 
The robot operates in two phases: 
1)exploration 
2)optimization.
    During the first phase, it follows the Left-Hand Rule to explore the maze, record intersections, and identify dead ends.
    In the second phase, it analyzes the recorded path to determine the shortest and most efficient route to the exit.

This project aims to provide an effective and low-cost solution for understanding the fundamental principles of robotics, automation, and AI-based 
path optimization. It is relevant for applications in robotics competitions, self￾driving vehicle research, industrial automation, and educational purposes.
By implementing real-time decision-making, sensor integration, and path memory storage, this project demonstrates a practical approach to autonomous 
navigation in unknown environments.

**Scope**

The scope of this project includes the design, development, and implementation of a maze-solving robot that can navigate autonomously using a sensor-based 
decision-making system. The robot is equipped with an Arduino Uno as the central microcontroller, Infrared sensors for path detection, and an L293D 
motor driver for movement control. The project involves implementing a Left￾Hand Rule-based algorithm for maze exploration and optimizing the navigation 
path for improved efficiency.

In addition to hardware and algorithm development, this project focuses on real￾time maze navigation, path recording, and adaptation to environmental changes. 
The robot is capable of detecting modifications in the maze and automatically adjusting its path by re-exploring the environment when necessary. The findings 
from this project can contribute to various fields such as autonomous navigation, warehouse automation, AI-driven robotics, and smart transportation 
systems. Future improvements may include machine learning-based navigation, additional sensor integration, and enhanced motor control for smoother

**Block diagram and explanation**

Key hardware components and their interconnections:

1. Power Supply
• The power supply provides the necessary electrical energy to the entire 
system.
• It powers the Arduino Uno, infrared sensors, and L293D motor 
driver.
• Usually, a 9V battery or a rechargeable Li-ion battery is used.
2. Start
• This represents the beginning of the maze-solving process.
• When the robot is turned on, it initializes all components and begins 
sensing the maze.
3. Infrared Sensors
• These are line-following sensors that detect black and white surfaces.
• The sensors help the robot identify the path, walls, and turns in the 
maze.
• Multiple sensors are used for better accuracy in detecting left, right, and 
forward paths.
4. Arduino Uno
• The central processing unit of the robot.
• It receives input from the IR sensors and processes the data.
• Based on the sensor input, it decides which motor to turn ON or OFF.
• It sends signals to the L293D motor driver to control the movement of 
the robot.
5. L293D Motor Driver
• The motor driver acts as a bridge between the Arduino and the motors.
• Since Arduino cannot supply enough power to drive the motors directly, 
the L293D amplifies the signals to control the DC motors.
• It allows bidirectional movement (forward and backward) and turns 
(left and right).
6. Left DC Motor & Right DC Motor
• These motors control the movement of the robot.
• By adjusting the speed and direction of each motor, the robot can move 
forward, turn left, turn right, or stop.

7. Wheels
• The motors drive the wheels, which move the robot along the maze.
• The motion of the wheels depends on the motor commands received from 
the Arduino.
8. End
• This represents the completion of the maze-solving process.
• Once the robot finds the correct path and reaches the exit, it stops or 
signals completion.

2. Initialize Sensors and Motors
  o The Arduino Uno sets up the infrared sensors and configures the motor driver.
3. Read Sensor Values
  o The infrared sensors detect the path and determine whether the 
robot is on track.
4. Decide Movement Based on Sensor Input
  o If all sensors detect a clear path → Move Forward
  o If the left sensor detects a black line → Turn Left
  o If the right sensor detects a black line → Turn Right
  o If both left and right sensors detect black → Stop & Decide (dead end or intersection)
5. Mark Paths and Record Movements
  o The robot stores movement data in memory (turns, paths, dead ends).
6. Check if the Endpoint is Reached
  o If no, continue exploring.
  o If yes, Phase 1 Ends and moves to Phase 2 (Optimization Phase).

  o The robot navigates directly using the stored optimal path.
10. Check if the Endpoint is Reached
  o If no, continue following the optimized path.
  o If yes, the maze is solved, and the robot stops.

**Results**

To present the results of this project, we can discuss the performance.functionality, and user experience aspects:
1. First Pass (Exploration Phase)
   During the first phase, the maze-solving robot explores the unknown maze, following the predefined movement logic using IR sensors. The robot:
    • Moves forward if a path is detected.
    • Turns left or right based on sensor input.
    • Records its movements in an array (path[]).
    • Encounters dead ends and performs backtracking, optimizing the path using simplifyPath().
  Observations:
    • The robot successfully explores various maze configurations.
    • The simplifyPath() function reduces redundant movements, improving efficiency.
2. Second Pass (Optimization Phase)
  After completing the exploration phase, the robot follows the optimized path stored in path[]. During this phase:
    • The robot directly follows the shortest route from start to goal without unnecessary turns.
    • Turns and movements are executed efficiently based on the recorded path.
    • The robot demonstrates a significant reduction in time taken compared to the first pass.
  Observations:
    • The robot completes the second pass faster than the first.
    • Redundant turns and backtracking steps are eliminated.
3. Automated Reset on Maze Change
  The robot is designed to detect changes in the maze structure after the first pass. If a new path appears or an existing one is blocked:
    • The sensors detect the change.
    • The robot resets itself (mazeChanged = true), erasing the old path.
    • A new exploration phase starts automatically to adapt to the updated maze.
  Observations:
    • The robot correctly identifies changes in the maze.
    • The automatic reset mechanism works effectively, allowing dynamic maze adaptation.
    • It successfully re-explores and re-optimizes the path for the new configuration.

**Final Outcome:**

• The maze-solving robot performs successfully in both static and dynamic environments.
• It efficiently detects, records, and optimizes paths for improved navigation.
• The automated reset feature allows it to re-explore and adapt to changes in real-time.
• This design can be further extended for real-world applications like autonomous delivery robots or search-and-rescue missions.
